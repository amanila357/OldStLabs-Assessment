Old. St Labs Assessment

This project was made using the following:

Spring Tool Suite 4
Java 8
Visual Studio Code
Node.js

The backend was created and ran using Spring Tool Suite 4, java 8 and maven, and it uses port 8080. On the frontend side it is created using "npx create-react-app my-app", and the port is set to the default 3000. Should there be any changes on the ports when you run the backend project, please edit the package.json of the frontend side and change the port of the "proxy" variable according to the port the backend is running.
